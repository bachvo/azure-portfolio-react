I must consider the workflow of a user and keep the user interface clean and usable following the principle of form follows function.

With these tools, I can iterate through mock-ups at a rapid pace in order to identify any issues that might occur later in the development cycle. I also test the low and high fidelity mock-ups by conducting user testing to examine the usability of the feature. In the development phase, I use Node.js as the application foundation and AngularJS to build controllers and API\’s to serve data to the client side, from databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Once the data is retrieved from the server I can build all necessary components that help complete the user interface with the correct data being served to the view.',

Arduino was implemented to power the rods and fans and from there, mobile devices were explored to create interactivity with the user. A Bluetooth chip Arduino microcontroller is used to calculate the accelerometer of the users phone to activate and de-activate the fan as the user interacts with his/her phone. The rods rotate from 4 servo motors that are attached to gears to be able to spin 13 rods. Users can control which direction the fan rotates as well as the speed of the rotation by simply moving the phone in the same direction and the degree in which the phone is tilted.',
